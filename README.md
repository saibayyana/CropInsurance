# 🌾 Blockchain-Based Crop Insurance System

This project aims to revolutionize the traditional crop insurance framework by integrating **machine learning** and **blockchain** to create a scalable, transparent, and efficient system. It is designed to improve claim processing speed, reward sustainable practices, and enhance financial resilience among farmers.

---

## 💡 Problem Statement

- Current crop insurance systems suffer from delays, inefficiencies, and lack of transparency.
- There is no incentive for farmers to adopt climate-resilient and sustainable farming practices.
- Manual claim processing leads to errors and long wait times, affecting farmer trust and stability.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Predict crop insurance eligibility using weather and geographical data.
- Implement and evaluate multiple machine learning models (Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression, KNN).
- Automate the data processing and prediction pipeline for large-scale deployment.
- Save predictions in a machine-readable JSON format for easy integration with other systems.
- Use blockchain to record insurance transactions for enhanced transparency and immutability.
- Develop real-time dashboards to display eligibility, model performance, and claim statuses.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models Used

- ✅ Random Forest
- ✅ Logistic Regression
- ✅ Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- ✅ K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Each model is evaluated for accuracy and efficiency in classifying insurance eligibility.

## 🔗 Blockchain Integration

- All transactions (claims, approvals, payouts) are logged on a blockchain ledger.
- Ensures **data immutability**, **auditability**, and **trust** among stakeholders.

---

## 📊 Dashboard Features

- Visual display of:
  - Model predictions (eligible/ineligible)
  - Accuracy metrics
  - Claim status updates
- Real-time, user-friendly interface for policy makers and insurers.

---

## 📁 Outputs

- Predictions stored in JSON format
- Audit logs stored securely on blockchain
- Dashboards for analysis and decision-making

---

## 🚀 Future Scope

- Integration with IoT-based weather stations for real-time data
- Expansion to include crop-specific risk modeling
- Incentive scoring system for sustainable farming techniques

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python** for ML and data processing
- **Solidity & Truffle** for blockchain smart contracts
- **Dash / Flask / Power BI** (optional) for dashboarding
- **GitHub** for version control and collaboration
